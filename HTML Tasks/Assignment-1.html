<h1 style="text-align:center;color:blue">Exploring the Mysteries of the Universe</h1>
<h2 style="color:purple">Dark Matter:</h2>
<p style="color:red;background-color:yellow">Dark matter is an elusive and invisible substance that makes up about 27% of the universe's total mass and energy. Unlike ordinary matter, 
it does not emit, absorb, or reflect light, making it undetectable through direct observation. Its existence is inferred from the gravitational effects it exerts on visible matter, such as galaxies 
and galaxy clusters. Dark matter is believed to play a crucial role in holding galaxies together and influencing their formation and evolution. Although its exact nature remains unknown, scientists
are exploring various theories, including the possibility of it being composed of yet-undiscovered subatomic particles. Despite being invisible, dark matter plays a crucial role in the formation and
 evolution of galaxies. It acts as a cosmic scaffold, providing the gravitational pull necessary to hold galaxies together, preventing them from flying apart due to their rotational speeds.
 Without dark matter, the structure of the universe as we know it would be vastly different, with galaxies and clusters unable to form. Various experiments, such as those conducted in deep 
 underground laboratories, are ongoing in an attempt to directly detect dark matter particles. While direct detection remains elusive, dark matter's influence on the universe is undeniable,
 shaping the cosmos on the largest scales.</p>
<h2 style="color:red">Dark Energy:</h2>
<p style="color:green;background-color:orange">Dark energy is a mysterious force that constitutes approximately 68% of the universe and is responsible for the accelerated expansion of the universe.
Discovered in the late 1990s, dark energy challenges our understanding of gravity and the cosmos. Unlike dark matter, which clumps together, dark energy appears to be uniformly distributed throughout 
space, exerting a repulsive force that drives galaxies apart. Its nature is one of the biggest questions in cosmology, with theories ranging from it being a property of space itself to a new kind 
of dynamic energy field. Understanding dark energy is crucial for unraveling the ultimate fate of the universe. Dark energy's discovery was a groundbreaking moment in cosmology,
fundamentally altering our understanding of the universe's fate. If dark energy continues to dominate, it could lead to scenarios like the "Big Freeze," where the universe expands indefinitely, 
cooling and thinning out over time. Some theories suggest that dark energy might change over time, leading to different cosmic outcomes, such as a "Big Rip" where the expansion becomes so
 intense that it tears apart galaxies, stars, and even atomic structures. The study of dark energy is closely linked with understanding the ultimate destiny of the universe, making it one of 
 the most intriguing and important areas of modern astrophysics.</p>
